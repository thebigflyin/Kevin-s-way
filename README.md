Kevin’s Way – Full-picture programming approach with progresive stepwise integration FLEX points if needed
Kevin’s Way – Key Features (Updated)

Big-picture outline first

Start with a clear vision of the final project so every step aligns with the end goal.

Progressive Modular Testing

Build and test each hardware or software component step by step.

Each module is calibrated and verified before moving on. This reduces errors and makes debugging easier.

FLEX points

Optional features or adjustable parameters (like dip switches, speeds) are explicitly marked.

Allows you to add complexity later without breaking the core system.

Stepwise integration

Once each module works, combine them gradually. Ensures the full system works reliably.

Iterative development

The system evolves into the final integrated project as each part is tested and added.

Why it works

Reduces risk: Problems are caught early in small modules.

Makes debugging easier: You know exactly which component might be causing an issue.

Flexible: Optional features (FLEX points) can be added later.

Scalable: Works for small Arduino projects or larger hardware-software systems.

Documentation-friendly: Stepwise approach naturally creates a clear development record.
